# Chapter 1: What Is Information?

Defining fundamental concepts is inherently challenging, as they form the foundation for all subsequent ideas. This difficulty is evident in various fields: physicists grapple with defining **matter** and **energy**, biologists struggle with the essence of **life**, and philosophers wrestle with the nature of **reality**. In contemporary discourse, **information** is increasingly recognized as a fundamental building block of reality, perhaps even more foundational than matter and energy. This chapter does not aim to resolve the myriad disputes surrounding the definition of information or its relationship to life and physics. Instead, it focuses on the historical significance of information in human societies.

In everyday language, "information" often refers to human-made symbols, such as spoken or written words. A poignant illustration of this is the story of **Cher Ami**, a carrier pigeon during World War I. When an American battalion found itself trapped behind enemy lines, Major Charles Whittlesey resorted to sending a message via Cher Ami, who bravely navigated through enemy fire to deliver the urgent plea for help. Despite the pigeon’s injuries, the message saved hundreds of lives. Cher Ami’s flight exemplifies how symbols—ink on paper—can convey critical information, even if the carrier itself lacks understanding of its significance.

However, information extends beyond human symbols. In biblical lore, **Noah** learns of the receding waters through a pigeon returning with an olive branch, while the rainbow serves as a divine promise. Such instances illustrate that objects—be they pigeons, stars, or even natural phenomena—can embody information depending on context. An astronomer might interpret the movement of galaxies as information about the universe's history, while an astrologer might view the same stars as a script for human fate. Thus, the definition of information is subjective, shaped by perspective.

This ambiguity is particularly evident in the realm of **military espionage**. During World War I, the NILI spy network utilized coded signals through window shutters to relay information about Ottoman troop movements to the British. This method, visible to many, was understood only by those in the know. The capture of a carrier pigeon by the Ottomans revealed the existence of the spy ring, demonstrating how context can transform an ordinary object into critical information.

The chapter argues that information cannot be narrowly defined as specific material objects; rather, it is context-dependent. The naive view of information posits that it represents reality, serving as a tool for truth-seeking. According to this perspective, information is valuable when it accurately reflects reality. For instance, if NILI reported ten thousand Ottoman soldiers in Gaza, this information would be crucial for military strategy. However, if the actual number were twenty thousand, the report would misrepresent reality, leading to potential disaster.

Yet, the author contends that most information does not aim to represent reality. While truth is defined as an accurate representation of reality, the majority of information in human society—much like in biological and physical systems—does not fulfill this role. This assertion forms a critical theoretical foundation for the book.

**Truth**, as understood here, is an accurate representation of certain aspects of reality. It operates under the premise of a universal reality shared by all. However, truth and reality are distinct; no account can encompass all aspects of reality. For example, a report stating that there are ten thousand Ottoman soldiers in Gaza may be factually correct but fails to capture the complexities of individual soldiers' experiences. The act of quantifying inherently overlooks unique differences, leading to a simplified understanding of a multifaceted situation.

Moreover, reality encompasses both objective facts and subjective viewpoints. Different cultures and individuals may interpret events through diverse lenses, yet this does not imply the existence of multiple realities. Instead, it highlights the complexity of a single reality that can be perceived differently. For instance, Sarah Aaronsohn's legacy is viewed variably by Israelis and Palestinians, reflecting the subjective nature of historical interpretation.

The chapter critiques the naive view that more information will inevitably lead to greater truthfulness. While it acknowledges that some information accurately represents reality, it emphasizes that this is not the defining characteristic of information. The example of **astrology** illustrates this point. Despite its lack of empirical grounding, astrology has historically influenced decisions and connected people, demonstrating that information can shape reality without necessarily representing it accurately.

The author posits that information's primary role is to **connect** disparate elements rather than merely represent reality. This connection can manifest in various forms, such as music, which synchronizes emotions and movements without needing to convey specific truths. Similarly, **DNA** serves as a form of information that connects biological systems, facilitating life processes without representing external realities.

The implications of this perspective are profound. Information is not merely a reflection of reality; it actively shapes new realities by forming connections. While truthful representations can foster connections—such as the global unity felt during the moon landing—erroneous representations can also create cohesive groups, as seen in the rise of conspiracy theories.

The chapter concludes by asserting that information is fundamentally about connection. While it sometimes represents reality, its primary characteristic is the ability to forge networks among individuals. This understanding allows for a nuanced examination of human history, where the effectiveness of information is measured not solely by its truthfulness but by its capacity to connect people and create new social realities.

In subsequent chapters, the author will explore the evolution of information networks throughout history, examining how various technologies have enhanced connectivity and cooperation, often without a corresponding increase in truthfulness. The first technology to be discussed is the **story**, which has been a vital tool for human connection since the dawn of civilization.
